# Basic Mathematic Operations

This project builds basic arithmetic operations — **addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division** — using only fundamental programming constructs (loops, conditionals, etc.). It also includes a simple user interface for interaction.

## Features

- Built-in arithmetic operations implemented from scratch
- Handles negative numbers and edge cases
- Simple and interactive command-line menu
- Looping system for repeated calculations

## Step-by-Step Functionality

### Step 1: Addition Function

- Use a loop to add `1` to the first number, `b` times  
- If the second number is negative, subtract instead

### Step 2: Subtraction Function

- Reuse the addition function  
- Subtract by **adding the negative** of the second number

### Step 3: Multiplication Function

- Use repeated addition in a loop  
- Track the sign to handle negative numbers

### Step 4: Division Function

- Use repeated subtraction to count how many times the divisor fits into the dividend  
- Handle:
  - Negative numbers
  - Division by zero with error checking

### Step 5: User Interface

- Text-based menu system with input validation  
- Loop to perform multiple operations  
- Clear and readable output of results
